# Important Notes for Developers

## 1. Code Structure
- Follow the MVC pattern for backend.
- Keep frontend components modular and reusable.

## 2. Authentication
- Use JWT for session management.
- Passwords should be hashed with Bcrypt.

## 3. Database
- Always validate input data before saving to MongoDB.
- Ensure the use of indexes for faster queries.

## 4. Testing
- Write unit tests for all major functions.
- Use Jest for backend and React Testing Library for frontend.

## 5. Deployment
- Make sure environment variables are correctly set in production.
- Test the app thoroughly before deploying to live.
